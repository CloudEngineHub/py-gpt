"Calculation of tokens is implemented in the application. The application "
"tries to predict the number of tokens that will be used for a given query"
" and shows this information in real time to the user. Thanks to this, you"
" can get better control over the tokens used. The application shows "
"information on how many tokens will be used for the prompt itself, how "
"much for the system prompt, how much for additional data and how many "
"tokens will be used in the context (memory of previous entries)."
