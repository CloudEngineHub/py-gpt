"**PYGPT** is a desktop application that allows you to talk to OpenAI's "
"artificial intelligence models such as **GPT4** and **GPT3** using your "
"own computer and ``OpenAI API``. It allows you to talk in chat mode and "
"in completion mode, as well as generate images using **DALL-E 2**. "
"Moreover, the application has implemented context memory support, context"
" storage, history of contexts, which can be restored at any time and e.g."
" continue the conversation from point in history, and also has a "
"convenient and intuitive system of presets that allows you to quickly and"
" pleasantly create and manage your prompts."
