"This is the default mode of operation and works very similarly to "
"**ChatGPT**. The mode allows you to talk to models such as **GPT3**, "
"**GPT3.5** and **GPT4**. You can switch between the currently used model "
"at any time."

"In the middle window of the application there is a chat window, and below"
" it there is a field for the text entered by the user (prompt). On the "
"right side of the application window, you can conveniently define your "
"own system prompt for the model at any time, or create a preset with a "
"prompt and save it, for example, for later use. This allows you to easily"
" and quickly switch between different starting configurations for the "
"model, and allows you to conveniently experiment with the whole thing."

"This is a more advanced and capable mode that allows more extensive use "
"of the **GPT3** model. It works similarly to a chat, but it allows for "
"more configuration and has more features than a regular chat. In this "
"mode, you can use the model for more tasks, such as completing text, "
"simulating conversation as various persons, analyzing text, and many "
"more."

"This mode additionally has fields in which you can enter a name for the "
"AI and for the user. This allows, for example, to simulate a conversation"
" as two fictitious actors, if so defined in the start prompt. Thanks to "
"these options, it is possible, for example, to simulate a conversation "
"between e.g. Batman and the Joker. ;)"
