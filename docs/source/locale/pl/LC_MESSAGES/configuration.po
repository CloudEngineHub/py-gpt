"- **Temperature** - defines the temperature of the conversation, the "
"lower the value, the more deterministic the model behaves, the higher the"
" value, the more abstract"

"- **Top-p** - a parameter similar to temperature, for details please "
"refer to the documentation on the OpenAI website"

"- **Use context** - enables or disables the use of context (memory of "
"previous conversation components). When this option is disabled, context "
"is not saved or used during the conversation"

#: ../../source/configuration.rst:27
msgid ""
"- **Store history** - enables or disables saving conversation history and"
" context. History is not written to disk after shutdown"

msgid ""
"- **Context threshold** - specifies the reserve of tokens required to "
"execute next prompt. If we are approaching the capacity of the model "
"(e.g. if the model allows 4096 tokens), this value will be used when "
"approaching the limit to leave place for the next answer."

"- **Max output tokens** - defines the maximum number of tokens to be "

msgid ""
"- **Max total tokens** - defines the maximum number of tokens that the "
"application can send to the model, including the entire context of the "
"conversation. It should be less than or equal to the model's maximum "
"capacity. By setting this limit, you can reduce the size of the context "
"attached to sent messages."
