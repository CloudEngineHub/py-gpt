Quick Start
===========

**Setting-up API Key(s)**

You can configure API keys for various providers, such as ``OpenAI``, ``Anthropic``, ``Google``, ``xAI``, ``Perplexity``, ``OpenRouter``, and more. This flexibility allows you to use different providers based on your needs.

During the initial setup, configure your API keys within the application.

To do so, navigate to the menu:

.. code-block:: ini

   Config -> Settings -> API Keys

Here, you can add or manage API keys for any supported provider.

**Configuring Provider**

1. **Select the Provider:** Choose a tab with provider.
2. **Enter the API Key:** Paste the corresponding API key for the selected provider.

**Example**

- **OpenAI:** Obtain your API key by registering on the OpenAI website: https://platform.openai.com and navigating to https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.
- **Anthropic, Google, etc.:** Follow similar steps on their respective platforms.

.. note::
   The ability to use models or services depends on your access level with the respective provider. If you wish to use custom API endpoints or local APIs that do not require API keys, simply enter any value into the API key field to bypass prompts about an empty key.
