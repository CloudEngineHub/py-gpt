What is PYGPT?
----------------

**PYGPT** is a desktop application that allows you to talk to OpenAI's artificial intelligence models such as **GPT4** and **GPT3** using your own computer and ``OpenAI API``. It allows you to talk in chat mode and in completion mode, as well as generate images using **DALL-E 2**. Moreover, the application has implemented context memory support, context storage, history of contexts, which can be restored at any time and e.g. continue the conversation from point in history, and also has a convenient and intuitive system of presets that allows you to quickly and pleasantly create and manage your prompts.
