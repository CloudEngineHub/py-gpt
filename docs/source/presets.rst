Presets
========

What is preset?
----------------
Presets (templates) are designed to save various configurations and allow you to use these 
settings at any time. A preset encompasses the chosen mode of operation (chat, completion, or image generation), 
an initialization (system) message, a name for the AI, a username, and the conversation "temperature" 
(where a higher value creates more abstract responses from the model, and a lower value results in more 
deterministic behavior). Presets function like *templates*. They can be applied in any mode and with models 
provided by both the ``OpenAI API`` and ``Langchain``.

You're free to add as many presets as you wish and switch between them whenever needed. 
Presets can also be duplicated, providing a starting point to create new ones based on existing configurations.
