**Files and attachments**

* ``Store attachments in the workdir upload directory``: Enable to store a local copy of uploaded attachments for future use. Default: True

* ``Store images, capture and uploads in data directory``: Enable to store everything in single data directory. Default: False

* ``Directory for file downloads``: Subdirectory for downloaded files, e.g. in Assistants mode, inside "data". Default: "download"

**Context**

* ``Context Threshold``: Sets the number of tokens reserved for the model to respond to the next prompt.

* ``Limit of last contexts on list to show  (0 = unlimited)``: Limit of the last contexts on list, default: 0 (unlimited).

* ``Use Context``: Toggles the use of conversation context (memory of previous inputs).

* ``Store History``: Toggles conversation history store.

* ``Store Time in History``: Chooses whether timestamps are added to the .txt files.

* ``Allow context item delete``: Enable display of the delete conversation item link.

* ``Context Auto-summary``: Enables automatic generation of titles for contexts, Default: True.

* ``Lock incompatible modes``: If enabled, the app will create a new context when switched to an incompatible mode within an existing context.

* ``Search also in conversation content, not only in titles``: When enabled, context search will also consider the content of conversations, not just the titles of conversations.

* ``Model used for auto-summary``: Model used for context auto-summary (default: *gpt-3.5-turbo-1106*).

* ``Prompt (sys): auto summary``: System prompt for context auto-summary.

* ``Prompt (user): auto summary``: User prompt for context auto-summary.

**Models**

* ``Max Output Tokens``: Sets the maximum number of tokens the model can generate for a single response.

* ``Max Total Tokens``: Sets the maximum token count that the application can send to the model, including the conversation context.

* ``RPM limit``: Sets the limit of maximum requests per minute (RPM), 0 = no limit.

* ``Temperature``: Sets the randomness of the conversation. A lower value makes the model's responses more deterministic, while a higher value increases creativity and abstraction.

* ``Top-p``: A parameter that influences the model's response diversity, similar to temperature. For more information, please check the OpenAI documentation.

* ``Frequency Penalty``: Decreases the likelihood of repetition in the model's responses.

* ``Presence Penalty``: Discourages the model from mentioning topics that have already been brought up in the conversation.

* ``Prompt (append): command execute instruction``: Prompt for appending command execution instructions.

**Images**

* ``DALL-E Image size``: The resolution of the generated images (DALL-E). Default: 1792x1024

* ``DALL-E Image quality``: The image quality of the generated images (DALL-E). Default: standard

* ``Open image dialog after generate``: Enable the image dialog to open after an image is generated in Image mode.

* ``DALL-E: Prompt (sys): prompt generation``: Prompt for generating prompts for DALL-E (if RAW mode is disabled).

* ``DALL-E: prompt generation model``: Model used for generating prompts for DALL-E (if RAW mode is disabled).

**Vision**

* ``Vision: Camera capture width (px)``: Video capture resolution (width).

* ``Vision: Camera capture height (px)``: Video capture resolution (height).

* ``Vision: Camera IDX (number)``: Video capture camera index (number of camera).

**Indexes (Llama-index)**

* ``Indexes``: List of created indexes.

* ``Vector Store``: Vector store to use (vector database provided by Llama-index).

* ``Excluded file extensions``: File extensions to exclude if no data loader for this extension, separated by comma.

* ``Additional keyword arguments (**kwargs) for data loaders``: Additional keyword arguments, such as settings, API keys, for the data loader. These arguments will be passed to the loader; please refer to the Llama-index or LlamaHub loaders reference for a list of allowed arguments for the specified data loader.

* ``Use local models in Video/Audio and Image (vision) loaders``: Enables usage of local models in Video/Audio and Image (vision) loaders. If disabled then API models will be used (GPT-4 Vision and Whisper). Note: local models will work only in Python version (not compiled/Snap). Default: False.
