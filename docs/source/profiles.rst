Profiles
=========

You can create many "profiles" for an app and switch between them. Each profile uses its own configuration, settings, history of contexts, and a separate folder for user files. This allows you to make many setups and quickly switch between them, changing the whole setting with one click.

The app allows you to make new profiles, edit existing ones, and duplicate current ones.

To make a new profile, select the option from the menu ``Config -> Profile -> New profile...``

To edit saved profiles, choose the option from the menu ``Config -> Profile -> Edit profiles...``

To switch to a created profile, pick the profile from the menu: ``Config -> Profile -> (profile name)``

Each profile uses its own user directory (workdir). You can link a newly created (or edited) profile to an already existing workdir with its configuration.

The name of the currently active profile is shown in (Profile Name) in the window title.
