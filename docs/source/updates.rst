Updating PYGPT
---------------
The application features built-in update notifications. Whenever there's a new version with fresh features 
available, you'll be notified within the application window.

To update, simply download the new version and start using it in place of the old one. All your settings, 
including contexts and history, will be preserved and accessible in the new version.
